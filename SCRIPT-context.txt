AI researcher Andrej Karpathy analyzed why Hinton’s prediction failed and identified characteristics that determine whether AI will thrive in a field.
Karpathy’s tweet: The source of the SCRIPT Framework
When looking for jobs that will change a lot due to AI on shorter time scales, I’d look in other places — jobs that look like repetition of one rote task, each task being relatively independent, closed (not requiring too much context), short (in time), forgiving (the cost of mistake is low), and of course automatable giving current (and digital) capability.
Distilling and formalizing Karpathy’s heuristic into its principal components yields the SCRIPT Framework for evaluating tasks’ suitability for AI automation:
Short: brief in time
Closed: requires limited context
Repetitive: repetition of one rote task
Independent: standalone
Permissive: forgiving of mistakes
Tech-ready: digitally automatable
The Two Dimensions of SCRIPT
SCRIPT’s six elements measure two fundamentally different aspects of AI automation feasibility:
1. Automation Readiness (R, P, T): Is this task suitable for automation at all?
Repetitive: Enables pattern learning
Permissive: Tolerates trial-and-error
Tech-ready: Digitally automatable
Tasks that are unique, require perfect accuracy, or involve physical components resist all automation, AI based or others.
2. Context Window Fit (S, C, I): Can this fit in an AI’s limited memory?
Short: Minimal data volume
Closed: Little background needed
Independent: No accumulated state
Tasks requiring extensive history, correlating thousands of events, or building context over time will overflow AI’s constraints.
